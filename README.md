# Reaction-Tester
Reaction Tester game developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This is a simple game which on clicking the start button, produces random coloured squares and rectangles of random size at random location on the page at random timing.

It then waits for the user to click the shape and displays the time elapsed(since the shape appeared and the click of the user), best-time, average-time and no of trials.

Hope you enjoy!

**Update**

This game was uploaded on a free hosting website and due to some inconvinience, the website is now un-available. The code still works and can be cloned and used/modified.
Cheers!
