# Reaction-Tester
Reaction Tester game developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This is a simple game which on clicking the start button, produces random coloured squares and rectangles of random size at random location on the page at random timing.

It then waits for the user to click the shape and displays the time elapsed(since the shape appeared and the click of the user), best-time, average-time and no of trials.
